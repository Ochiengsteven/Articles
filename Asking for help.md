# Seeking Help



In this article, we will discuss the art of seeking help effectively when you encounter challenges in your learning journey.

## Why is Seeking Help Important?
Asking for help is a *vital aspect* of successfully progressing as a software developer. It's not only normal and expected to ask questions; it's a necessary step in your growth. Often, learners may feel they should know everything on their own, but leaning on your community can provide answers quickly. At Microverse, we prioritize *swift and efficient problem-solving* over going it alone. However, it's important to demonstrate that you've made an effort to find the answer independently before seeking assistance.

#### Questions to Ask Yourself:
- What are your concerns regarding the current module in PLP?
- What is the desired outcome you are aiming for?
- What steps have you taken to expand your knowledge about the module's topic? Which sources have you consulted independently?
- Has seeking information resolved your concerns? If not, who do you plan to ask for help?

## Asking Great Questions
Asking the right questions is a skill that can greatly aid you in overcoming obstacles and obtaining the assistance you need.

  Good questions align with the type of information you are seeking and consider the time and attention of the person you are asking. Various question types include:
  - *Factual or Information Questions* (e.g., "Where can I find X?")
  - *Procedural Questions* (e.g., "How do I do Y?")
  - *Questions about Feelings or Thoughts* (e.g., "What does conflict mean to you?")
  - *Questions about Unknown Experiences* (e.g., "What if my first job requires me to move?")

  According to author and investor Tim Ferriss, you can improve the quality of answers and build stronger relationships with busy professionals (e.g., your mentor, your boss, your teacher) by asking questions that:

  - Can be answered quickly
  - Include examples
  - Aren't something you could find on Google
  - Aren't overly broad

  In short, good questions are *focused and thought-provoking*. However, don't hesitate to ask so-called "dumb" questions, as they can be immensely valuable for success. The key is to listen attentively, overcome your fear of appearing foolish, and ask your questions.
