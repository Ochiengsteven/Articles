As a developer this a very important tool that you'll be using to make open source contributions and also submittion of your code to a specified repo(We mainly use this for hackathon code submittions in Power Learn Project).

## Steps:

1. Make sure you are logged in your github account
2. Click the github link you were given for submition e.g https://github.com/kamausuzan197/Power-Hacks-Nigeria..git *This is the submision link that was used for the powerhacks nigeria*
